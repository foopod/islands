# Islands

This was an experiment in making NFTs. Please read the [blog post](https://jonoshields.com/post/nft-experience) if you are curious.

In this repo you will find the following...

+ [/gen0](https://github.com/foopod/islands/tree/main/gen0) - The first attempt at procedurally generating Islands
+ [/gen1](https://github.com/foopod/islands/tree/main/gen1) - The second attempt at procedurally generating Islands
+ [/gen0/islands_gen0](https://github.com/foopod/islands/tree/main/gen0/islands_gen0) - The generated outputs of gen0
+ [/gen1](https://github.com/foopod/islands/tree/main/gen1/islands_gen1) - The generated outputs of gen1
+ [/example.html](https://github.com/foopod/islands/tree/main/example.html) - Voxel based rendering
+ [/example_v2.html](https://github.com/foopod/islands/tree/main/example_v2.html) - Upscaled Polygon rendering

You can also explore the islands here...

+ [polygon example](https://foopod.github.io/islands/example.html)

/explore.html no longer works as it required a service to validate ownership of an Island, the service also responded with the data needed for rendering. Although you should be able to use the above examples with your own Island data should you want to render your own Island.
